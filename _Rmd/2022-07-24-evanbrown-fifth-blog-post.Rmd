### Thoughts on R and plans to use in the future?

I really like using R. For one, it's great for me that it's free to use. For two, collaboration has been easy for me and I love the flexibility in the language. And for three, it's really limitless and it has been neat to look at all the different things R can be used for. I will definitely continue to use R going forward. I use it at work frequently already and certainly plan to keep going in that direction. Since I'm always on the front end planning and running experiments at work, learning R has allowed me to take over internal data analysis and has really streamlined our work by giving me the reigns on experiments from end to end. 

### Things to do differently

As I've mentioned before, I was very excited to start this class to really gain the skills necessary to run experiments end to end in our lab. Since about the midterm in this class, I've been able to get going with R at work and have analyzed data of two chemical screens, one using some EPA packages (tcpl) for fitting hill curves and the other using ggplot to create boxplots looking for shifts in chemicals. Here is an example of the boxplots I made (we are looking for one or multiple shifts among the Cyp's - yaxis - for each chemical - 2165 chemicals, 2165 plots):

As you can see, Cyp2A6 shifts this chemical outside the bounds of our controls (NoRNA and Bgal). This screen in particular was neat for me. We started this screen the week this class started, which unfortunately coincided with my visit to the emergency room (thanks again for the leniency on HW2). Throughout that recovery process was a constant struggle to get the data collected for this screen while maintaining my effort in this class. To wrap it all up by actually using what I had learned in this class to analyze the data was really rewarding and something we plan to continue going forward. And hopefully without any more ER visits!

### Areas of statistics/data science to explore further

A couple things are on the back burner right now. First, at work we have some R code that will output log spaced dose concentrations and something called alt-log spaced doses that is useful for screening chemicals when we evaluate cyps. Alt-log shifts the doses closer together towards the top end of the dose range where most cyp activity occurs, that way we can get a better feel for exactly where the activity is taking place. This isn't straightforward, and for some people designing experiments who aren't familiar, it can be confusing. Now that I know shiny, people just want to use me!! - but I've been asked to create a shiny app that people can use where experiment designers can just input their top and bottom concentrations, number of concentrations, and select log or alt-log spacing, and then get returned a table of the concentrations they should use. Prety simple and straightforward.

For statistics, I'm obviously interested in learning more in general as I begin the masters program next semester. In particular, I have enjoyed learning certain tests and statistical values that are industry specific. For example, we use a Z prime (Z') metric for evaluating an assay's effectiveness. This metric is 1 - (3 x standard deviation from the top concentration + 3 x std dev vehicle control)/(signal from top - control). This gives a value of 1 at the top end and a results >0.5 is a good working assay, while an assay <0 is a bad, non functional assay. Areas in the middle are typically a grey area where the assay may be able to be improved in some ways to make a working one. As I learning new things from this statistics program, it is ever more interesting to find ways to apply them to research at work and get practical use in applying them. 

Finally, for myself - I'm big into the outdoors, hunting, fishing, etc. Growing up around it, you learn that animals change their behavior a lot depending on the weather. However, there are some stronger indicators than other. For example, deer in the fall tend to be much more active overall when the temperature is colder. This is well agreed upon. However, some people will also say they're more active in the daytime when the moon is closer to full, more active in evenings when pressure is high, etc. I've had an idea to capture deer activity metrics and model that to all the different weather predictors. I know of one app out there that tries to do something like this, but obviously their formulas are "top secret". They'll basically just give you a prediction of deer activity (high, medium, low) based on weather in your region of the country. Then as a user, you can choose the high days to go sit and the low days you can sit at home, etc. Great idea to take peoples money but I don't necessarily trust it for two reasons: for one, the app was developed in the Midwest, so I'm unsure of how much research was done here in the east, and for two, animal activity can differ from farm to farm, so regional classification that includes both the Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia doesn't sound very specific or necessarily effective. I've thought about doing something small scale on our own farms to develop a predictive model for personal use - hopefully increasing chances of seeing stuff when in the woods. Obviously the most challenging part of this is going to be capturing activity through the use of visuals, trail cameras, etc when I don't have the budget to tranquilize and collar track deer. But, we'll see how it goes on my "extra spending money" budget and hopefully it turns up something useful - I'm sure I will at least like going through the process of attempting this and then maybe flesh out some further ideas for when I no longer have to pay for grad school and can roll some more funds this way!

I have really enjoyed this course, thank you for all the support!
