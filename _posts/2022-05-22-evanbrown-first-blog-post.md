### What is Being a Data Scientist All About?

The term 'data scientist' can often have a muddied definition. That's because data scientists can come from many different backgrounds and work across a variety of sectors. However, data scientists are far from ambiguous. They are in fact unique in their ability to bridge the gap between industry knowledge, programming skills, and statistical analysis. Knowing how to code is great, and likewise, knowledge of complex statistical analyses is also great. But without a business, company, or organizations goal, then what would be the point of analyzing data? Being a data scientist is about a cyclical thought process: Industry knowledge -> Statistical Understanding -> Coding Efficiency -> repeat. Starting with industry knowledge is critical because this is what separates a data scientist from a "coder" or "statistician". Having the industry knowledge, and the ability to know which questions need answered, allows data scientists to leverage their statistical and coding skills to solve industry problems in real time.

### Data Scientists: Major Duties and Knowledge Areas

Data scientists take on a broader role than just statisticians or just coders, but data scientists aren't data scientists without both of those skills. It's important for data scientists to have in depth knowledge about statistics including probabilities, variabilities, regression and more. On the other hand, it is also important for data scientists to have strong programming skills in R, Python, SAS and more. However, as mentioned before, a key third tool in a data scientists toolbox is their industry knowledge. Say you work for a tech company and need to determine which ads will do best in certain situations, it is important that a data scientist be knowledgeable of the tech company, its goal, and how ads are used to generate revenue. In another example, say you work for a science organization that needs to analyze screening data for potentially toxic chemicals. It is important that a data scientist be knowledgeable of the biological implications of the data they are analyzing in order to make relevant conclusions to present to say, a manager.

### Data Scientist Versus Statisticians

While this article may seem overly highly on data scientists and low on "just statisticians", know that often statisticians may be better suited for roles where a higher level of statistical expertise is required, and thus have plenty of opportunities for success despite the presence of data scientists in the marketplace. While both data scientists and statisticians may find themselves applying for the same job, some similarities and differences may present themselves. Similarly, both data scientists and statisticians focus on analysis and interpretation of data. Both also typically have a strong math and statistics background. However, statisticians typically focus on smaller data with more traditional methods of data collection including surveys and polls. Then, statisticians typically work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data. Data scientists on the other hand typically work with bigger data and spend more time on data ingest, cleansing and transformation. Then, data scientists typically work to compare predictive accuracy of multiple models to select the best one.

### Where do I Fit in?

I belong in the data scientist camp and here's why.

Animal testing can elicit mixed emotions in people, but regardless of your emotions, it is very costly and time intensive, making it less than ideal for testing chemicals for toxicity when there are over 10,000 untested chemicals in line. To solve this, new alternative approach methods (NAMS) are constantly being developed to screen chemicals quicker and cheaper in cell-based assays to determine endpoint specific cellular response (i.e. is chemical X toxic to the androgen receptor in HepG2 cells). A framework for determining whether or not a chemical is toxic in NAMS includes multiple assays and multiple endpoints, requiring big data generation. I currently work on developing and generating several NAMS for evaluating endocrine toxicity. The center I work in then uses this data to develop several models for predicting toxicity that are each evaluated for predictive accuracy. Ultimately, the goal is to make the future chemicals evaluation process accurate, much less animal and cost intensive, and reduce time to screen by years. Because of the use of big data, coding, multiple models, and the need to connect the data analyses to the biology - and quite frankly the fact the I spend equal amounts of time doing biology as I do coding and statistics - this is why I belong in the data scientist camp.
