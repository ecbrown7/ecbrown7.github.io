    - Personal Life

I grew up near Lake Norman, North Carolina where I went to high school. I spent my first year of college at University of North Carolina at Charlotte in Environmental Engineering before transferring to NC State and switching into the Biochemistry program. I was a teaching assitant for two biochemistry classes in which one I was able to teach a weekly review session. I worked in Dr. Doherty's Biochemistry laboratory performing research investigating a protein-protein interaction in plants. 

Upon graduating in 2018, I accepted a position on a research project at the US Environmental Protection Agency that focuses on developing assays to screen for chemicals that disrupt endocrine receptors in the body. What makes our work uniquely challenging is the layering of cytochrome p450 enzymes onto our assays. These are liver enzymes responsible for metabolizing chemicals you ingest. Typical chemical screening conditions evaluate parent chemical only. However with the addition of these enzymes, we are able to capture both the parent chemical *and* any metabolites that may form, with non-toxic parent chemicals potentially rendered toxic after being metabolized. We have succesfully developed assays for both the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor and have proven cyp enzyme functionality with validation screens.

Outside of work, most of my time is spent working out or capturing pictures of wildlife in the mountains of Southwest Virginia (see below). In the past 2 years I have run 3 half marathons and am looking forward to another in the fall.
